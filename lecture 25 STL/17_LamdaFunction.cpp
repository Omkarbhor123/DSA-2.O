LAMDA 
C++ 11 introduced lambda expressions to allow inline functions which can be used for short snippets of code that
 are not going to be reused and therefore do not require a name. In their simplest form a lambda expression can be defined as follows: 

[ capture clause ] (parameters) -> return-type  
{   
   definition of method   
} 

Generally, the return-type in lambda expressions is evaluated by the compiler itself and we don’t need to specify it explicitly.
 Also the -> return-type part can be ignored.  However, in some complex cases e.g. conditional statements, the compiler can’t determine 
 the return type and explicit specification is required.
